## Description 🔎
We can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

## Table of Contents 📖
- [Installation](#installation) ⚙️
- [Usage](#usage) 🔑
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Test](#tests) 🧪
- [License](#license-📝)
- [link](#license) 📝

## Installation ⚙️
The application will be invoked by using the following command:

## Usage 🔑
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions WHEN I enter my project title THEN this is displayed as the title of the README WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under WHEN I enter my GitHub username THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile WHEN I enter my email address THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
